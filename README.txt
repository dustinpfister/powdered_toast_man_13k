This is a project for the 2015 js13kgames competition that can be found at http://js13kgames.com/


Thanks for having an interest in checking out this project I worked on for the competition I have been 
participating in once a year sense 2013. I would have put more effort into this one, but lately I was 
more interested in enjoying what remains of my summer rather then spending it parked in front of a computer.



Background:

Oh No! Ren And Stimpy are all out of powdered Toast! What ever shale they do? 

"Leave Everything to me!" - Powdered Toast Man.



How to play the game:

1) Click and drag the Toaster dial to the desired setting! The higher the setting the higher the starting 
altitude, and flight power.

2) Click and drag the toaster bar all the way down, then let go. After which Powdered Toast Man will shoot 
into the sky.

3) Once powdered toast man reaches his starting altitude he will level out, and begin to fly backwards. 
During this time as long as his flight power remains above zero, you can change his pitch by clicking and 
dragging above and below him. The red rectangle indicates the direction of the house you want to get to.

4) When/if Powdered toast man runs out of flight power he will enter a free fall.

5) The game ends when powdered toast man lands at the house or not. If he lands at the house you win a log! 
If not you get squat. Either way you can click the screen to play again if you want to.
